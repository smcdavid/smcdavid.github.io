						<h2><strong>Researching Our Domain</strong></h2>
						<p>We conducted a wide array of secondary, primary, and design research. Secondary research included literature reviews of NASA, our analogous domains,	competitors, and academic journals in the fields of HCI, psychology, and cognitive science. Primary research included interviews with many NASA stakeholders, analogous domain professionals, and one former SpaceX employee. Utilizing affinity diagrams and contextual inquiry, we synthesized our research and generated design ideas, which we then tested using storyboard speed-dating.

							<h2>Concept Generation from Our Research Insights</h2>
						</header>	
						<p>With the conclusion of our Spring research, our insights converged broadly to four key areas: Knowledge Loss, Training and Trust, Moving Away from Paper, and Launch Day Communication. They each have potential for many design opportunities. Moving forward, we will hone in on one or two interrelated areas to design, develop, and test a robust prototype that would address NASA’s primary problem space.</p>

The integration engineers are located in the center among the seven engineering teams on the main floor.</p>
