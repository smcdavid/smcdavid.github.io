						<h2><strong>Designing and Iterating</strong></h2>
						<p>After spending about five months researching and coming up with four main insights, we narrowed to three main problems that we were trying to solve.

												<p><strong>Lose Critical Event Prioritization over OIS</strong>
												<br>
												With verbal communication over the Operational Intercom System (OIS), all information is disseminated with equal importance. The Integration Engineer is often listening to six to eight active channels simultaneously. Critical event announcements that require immediate attention, like the incorrect amount of liquid hydrogen in the fuel tank, must compete with less pressing dialog.</p>
											</div>										
											<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
												<span class="icon featured fa-bolt" style="color:#D32F2F"></span>
												<p><strong>Miss Valuable Information on the Intercom System</strong>
												<br>
												Information communicated over OIS is only temporarily available. If the Integration Engineer misses part of a conversation, he must ask the speaker to repeat. This is an unnecessary encumbrance in the fast-paced and high-stress troubleshooting environment.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
												<span class="icon featured fa-bolt" style="color:#D32F2F"></span>
												<p><strong>Unable to Quickly Access Relevant Information</strong>
												<br>
												NASA generates a huge amount of data leading up to launch, but only a small subset of this data is helpful to the Integration Engineer. Time is very valuable, especially toward the end of launch countdown, so it is disadvantageous when the Integration Engineer must spend time searching for the data he needs.</p>

									<h2>Notifications</h2>
									<p>Notifications serve the Integration Engineer the information he needs,
									right when he needs it. Although Loop rarely aims to
									pull the Integration Engineer’s attention away from his complex and vital
									work, there are five categories of critical events that
									the Integration Engineer can not afford to miss. “Break-break” alerts are
									of the highest importance and alert the launch room
									team to stop whatever they are engaged in, as there is
									a critical issue that must be resolved. Anomaly calls are
									the second-most important type of notification. They
									denote the start of the troubleshooting process led by
									the Integration Engineer. The Integration Engineer also
									needs to act when his call-sign (his title in the launch
									room) is mentioned. Lastly, events such as Milestones,
									such as the start of fueling, and weather conditions,
									such as lightning or winds over a certain threshold,
									also demand the Integration Engineer’s immediate attention. Currently
									these events are only announced over the intercom,
									where they must compete with many conversations
									happening simultaneously. Conversely, Loop uses
									notifications to provide a redundant and prominent
									avenue to receive this essential information.

									<h2>Transcription</h2>
									<p>The Integration Engineer always misses important information said over
									OIS. Powered by Google Cloud Speech API, Loop
									transcribes every communication channel and allows
									the user to navigate between them. The transcription
									of simultaneous lines of verbal communication
									provides the Integration Engineer with a point of reference that he
									can access whenever necessary. It also highlights
									significant words and transforms them into buttons
									to direct users to relevant information. Details in the
									scroll bar empower the Integration Engineer with the ability to scan the
									transcription for specific details that are relevant to his
									current task.</p>
									<p>NASA personnel in the launch room customize their
									tools and workspace using post-it’s, annotations,
									order, and other techniques. Our research revealed
									that they find this sort of personal organization
									reassuring and helpful. Therefore, it is important that
									Loop also enables customization, and this is available
									with keywords. The Integration Engineer can enter specific keywords
									that are important to him and the transcription will
									highlight them, making them easily identifiable.</p>

									<h2>Data Integration</h2>
									<p>NASA generates an exorbitant amount of data on
									every aspect of the vehicle. The Integration Engineer needs to access this
									information when troubleshooting an anomaly. Loop’s
									data integration in the Dashboard empowers the Integration Engineer to
									interact with disparate data presented succinctly and
									intuitively, uncovering relationships between related
									technical requirements and real-time telemetry sensor
									data from the spacecraft and rocket. Within this
									unified, customizable environment, the Integration Engineer can move
									onto in-depth analysis, status discovery, and towards
									finalizing a decision to launch. Loop also presents a
									variety of methods to access this information because
									each scenario can require a vastly different approach.</p>
