												<p><strong>Lose Critical Event Prioritization over OIS</strong>
												<br>
												With verbal communication over OIS, all information is disseminated with equal importance. The Integration Engineer is often listening to six to eight active channels simultaneously. Critical event announcements that require immediate attention, like this Liquid Hydrogen Tank Level Anomaly, must compete with less pressing dialog.</p>
											</div>										
											<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
												<span class="icon featured fa-bolt" style="color:#D32F2F"></span>
												<p><strong>Miss Valuable Information on the Intercom System</strong>
												<br>
												Information communicated over OIS is only temporarily available. If the Integration Engineer misses part of a conversation, he must ask the speaker to repeat. This is an unnecessary encumbrance in the fast-paced and high-stress troubleshooting environment.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
												<span class="icon featured fa-bolt" style="color:#D32F2F"></span>
												<p><strong>Unable to Quickly Access Relevant Information</strong>
												<br>
												NASA generates a huge amount of data leading up to launch, but only a small subset of this data is helpful to the Integration Engineer. Time is very valuable, especially toward the end of launch countdown, so it is disadvantageous when the Integration Engineer must spend time searching for the data he needs.</p>

												<p><strong>Notifications</strong>
												<br>
												 Notifications grab the Integration Engineer's attention to provide the right information at the right time. Critical events must emerge from the cacophony of less significant verbal exchanges. Notifications ensure that the information the Integration Engineer receives is prioritized and clear.</p>

												<span class="icon featured fa-pencil-square-o" style="color:#1DE9B6"></span>
												<p><strong>Transcription</strong>
												<br>
												Transcription provides a permanent backup of the information shared among experts during launch countdown. Engineers can refer to the information whenever necessary. Furthermore, the transcript serves as an entry point into the data.</p>

												<p><strong>Data Integration</strong>
												<br>
												In order to be useful, the data the Integration Engineer views must be relevant. The dashboardâ€™s hierarchy and structure empower the Integration Engineer to rapidly access the important information he needs to support his decisions.</p>
