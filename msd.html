				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>Our team was tasked with designing the User Experience for a peer economy mobile app. We had to select from one of four target areas. We selected homeowners with parkings spaces and drivers with limited parking options. Using the mobile platform we created PeerPark, a system that would bring two different user roles, with different goals, together in value co-production.</p>

				<h3>Ecosystem Collection</h3>
				<p>The first step was figuring out what we knew about the space we were working in and the assumptions that we were making. We concluded that we needed to do more research to find out if homeowners felt comfortable lending out their parking space.</p>

				<h3>Guerilla Research</h3>
				<p>We started with a competitive analysis to see what the existing landscape looked like and find out what was already offered by other companies.</p>
				<p>Next we interviewed 5-10 homeowners and 1-3 drivers to find out how they felt about a parking lot sharing service.</p> 
				<p>We found the following three concerns throughout our interviews:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Safety: </strong>Homeowners were worried about strangers using their space and both were concerned about how to deal with damage to property/vehicle.</li>
					<li><strong>Connection: </strong>Homeowners wanted to meet drivers before allowing them to park. The only cases where a homeowner had rented out their spot was when they were referred a driver (from a friend) or already knew them personally.</li>
					<li><strong>Communication: </strong>Neither party wanted much communication with each other once the connection had been made. They wanted the driver to be able to go in and out without notifiying the homeowner.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Exploration</h3>
				<p>We created 20 exploratory scenarios as a team that describe how the app might deliver value to our two personas (homeowner and driver). A section of them can be seen below. The full list can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yScO3h5CZzFTiuvHU4Oi1VeIVDO3hx8OjxTPOO_R9ho/edit#heading=h.4qq0sv3abcqh" target="_blank">process document</a></p>

				<h3>Vision</h3>
				<p>After going through the exploratory scenarios we realized that we had three value propositions for our users:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Driver/Parker: </strong>Easy, cheap, close parking at his/her choice.</li>
					<li><strong>Homeowner: </strong>Extra income, security, sharing spare resource.</li>
					<li><strong>Neighborhood: </strong>Safety, bustle.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
				<p>After finding the value we would supply to our two types of users we created storyboards representing each benefit.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>The first shows a benefit for the homeowner:</strong>

					<strong>The second shows a benefit for the driver:</strong>

					<strong>The third is an added bonus for using the app: </strong>

				</p>
			
				<h3>Wireframing</h3>
				<p>To begin design of our mobile application we created whiteboard drawings as a team and quickly moved to sketches on paper.</p>

				</figure>
				<h3>Initial Screen Design</h3>
				<p>After coming up with a suitable paper wireframes we moved to an early digital version using Sketch.</p>

					<figcaption class="pushed">First digital iteration of driver's experience using our app.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<h3>High Fidelity Screen Design: Iteration 1</h3>
				<p>The screen design follows the principles of minimalism. We aimed to design a user interface that was easy for users to quickly select and reserve a parking spot in just a few clicks.</p>

					<figcaption class="pushed">First high fidelity iteration of the  driver's experience using our app.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>High Fidelity Screen Design: Iteration 2</h3>
				<p>In the second iteration, we added an additional history screen for parkers, on which they can see information such as time elapsed and cost of the spot they are currently parking at or have parked at before.</p>
				<p>We also added a bottom menu bar to give users a better understanding of what section of the app they are in.</p>

					<figcaption class="pushed">Second high fidelity iteration of the driver's experience using our app.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>High Fidelity Screen Design: Final Iteration</h3>
				<p>In the third iteration, we focused improving the design of the last history screen.</p>
				<p>We added words "elapsed" and "remaining" besides the appropriate icons to avoid any confusion users may have with the two time icons.</p>
				<p>We also re-designed the top navbar to make it consistent with other screens, as well as minimized the cancel button to make better use of the white space</p>
