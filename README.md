For this project, we created an interactive storytelling experience using D3 and other libraries such as 
bootstrap, leaflet, and odometer to create a cohesive experience. Our website is available at http://jprathipati.com/Vis-FinalProject/ 
for viewing. 

For data, we wrote a webscraper using beautiful soup and created JSON files from the new american economy website. In addition to that we used INC to find resources on CEO's and other data about companies such as people employed. Looking through our repository, we implemented a bulk of our project in the index.html file in addition to the d3scripts.js and new.js. In terms of CSS, our style.css contains most of the styling that we wanted to have. Looking through those three files should give you a sense of our work on this project. Finally, our process document and screen cast are at the root level of this directory for viewing purposes.
